# pgrollup [![Build Status](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/pgrollup/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/pgrollup/actions)

**tl;dr**
This extension uses [monoids]() to solve the [incrementally refresh materialized view problem]() in Postgres.
The extension can be used to compute aggregate functions (e.g. `count(*)`, `count(distinct *)`, `avg`, `median`, etc.) in only O(1) time during the `SELECT` statement by precomputing these values in a "rollup" table.
The rollup table is precomputed automatically and the use of monoids ensures that these computations are asymptotically efficient.
(All previous implementations, including the system in OracleDB, do not use monoids, and are therefore not asymptotically efficient.)
The extension also introduces a new syntax for semantically defining these rollup tables trivially.

The extension should work with any postgres version >= 10.
See the [Limitations]() Section for details.

## The Problem

```
CREATE TABLE access_logs (
    id                  BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    access_time         TIMESTAMPTZ,
    ipaddr              INET,
    bytes_transferred   INT,
    status_code         SMALLINT
);
```

```
SELECT count(*) FROM access_logs WHERE status_code=200;
```

```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW access_logs_view AS (
    SELECT
        count(*)                    AS num_connections,
        count(distinct ipaddr)      AS unique_ips,
        min(bytes_transferred)      AS min_bytes,
        max(bytes_transferred)      AS max_bytes,
        avg(bytes_transferred)      AS avg_bytes,
        stddev(bytes_transferred)   AS stddev_bytes,
        percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY bytes_transferred) AS median_bytes,
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY status_code
);
```

Now we can get the repeat our `SELECT` statement above as follows
```
SELECT num_connections FROM access_logs_view WHERE status_code=200;
```
This select statement takes time only O(1) instead of O(k).
The problem, however, is what happens when we get new data to add to the table?
In current versions of Postgres (<= version 13),
we must fully recompute view with the following command:
```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW access_logs_view;
```
This is an expensive operation when the underlying `access_logs` table is large---if the underlying table is 10s of terabytes,
refreshing the view could take hours or even days!

**The Goal:**
What we need is a way to "incrementally" update only those parts of the materialized view that have changed.
These incremental updates are a widely requested feature among users (e.g.
[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47211576/refresh-only-part-of-a-materialized-view),
[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29437650/how-can-i-ensure-that-a-materialized-view-is-always-up-to-date),
[3](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/86779/refresh-materalized-view-incrementally-in-postgresql),
[4](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/165948/refresh-a-postgresql-materialized-view-automatically-without-using-triggers),
[5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59864339/best-way-to-pre-aggregate-time-series-data-in-postgres)).
A large number of attempts have been made to partially solve this problem,
but none of the existing attempts are optimal.
We now review these existing attempts and their shortcomings:

### Existing Incomplete Solution 1: Native Oracle/Postgres support

The Oracle database has built-in support for incremental refreshes (see [the docs](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DWHSG/refresh.htm#DWHSG-GUID-64068234-BDB0-4C12-AE70-75571046A586)) and there's currently a patch for Postgres to implement this feature in a similar manner (see [the postgres wiki page](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Incremental_View_Maintenance), [author's blog post](https://pgsqlpgpool.blogspot.com/2019/08/automatically-updating-materialized.html), [mailinglist conversation](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/20181227215726.4d166b4874f8983a641123f5%40sraoss.co.jp), and [the github repo](https://github.com/sraoss/pgsql-ivm/issues)).
It's possible this patch will make it into the standard Postgres as early as version 14.

The fundamental limit of both of these implementations, however, is that they do not take advantage of any monoid/group structure inherent in aggregate functions.
Monoids and groups are widely known in functional programming community for their ability to speed up parallel programming tasks,
but AFAIK they have never been used to speed up incremental refreshes.
See the [implementation details]() below for a full description of exactly what monoids and groups are,
and how the pgrollup extension uses these algebraic structures for faster updates.

### Existing Incomplete Solution 2: Triggers

The standard solution to this problem in existing postgres installations is to create [rollup tables](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/10/31/materialized-views-vs-rollup-tables/) manually.
These rollup tables typically use triggers to automatically update the rollup table whenever an update happens in the underlying table.

These trigger-based solutions, however, also have significant limitations:

1. Writing the appropriate triggers is a complex process,
   and there are currently no standard best practices.
   A quick google search will reveal many possible trigger architectures (e.g. 
[1](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/materialized-view-strategies-using-postgresql),
[2](http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/Tidbits/matviews.html),
[3](https://stefan-poeltl.medium.com/views-v-s-materialized-views-v-s-rollup-tables-with-postgresql-2b3824b45330),
[4](https://dzone.com/articles/scalable-incremental-data-aggregation-on-postgres),
[5](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/07/19/3-ways-to-maintain-rollup-tables-in-sql/)
   ).
   No matter which architecture you pick, the resulting code can be hundreds of lines long, and bugs are both common, subtle, and extremely difficult to detect.
   Common classes of bugs include:
   1. not handling floating point arithmetic properly, resulting in [catestrophic cancellation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) and silently incorrect results
   1. not handling `NULL` values correctly, resulting in either failed `INSERT`s or silently incorrect results
   1. writing triggers for only the `INSERT` operation, forgetting about the `UPDATE`/`DELETE` operations, resulting in silently incorrect results when those operations are used

   The pgrollup extension fully automates this entire process.
   Rather than writing hundreds of lines of complex, error-prone trigger logic that describes *how* to update the rollup table,
   the pgrollup extension lets you write a short 3-4 line semantic description of *what* your rollup table should contain.
   The library automatically implements the *how* for you.
   The [Solution]() Section below shows the syntax and implementation details.

1. Perhaps surprisingly, many existing hand-written rollup table solutions are significantly faster than the native Oracle/Postgres solutions because they use monoids to make their code asymptotically efficient.
   For example, you can find advanced monoid solutions based on the [HyperLogLog](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/06/30/efficient-rollup-with-hyperloglog-on-postgres/) and the [t-digest](https://stackify.com/sql-percentile-aggregates-and-rollups-with-postgresql-and-t-digest/) at the preceding links.

   This library automates the process of implementing these monoids/groups in your database rollup tables,
   and also provides a centralized reference of all the existing monoids/groups currently implemented in postgres.
   See the [Monoids/Groups]() section below for a list of currently implemented monoids/groups and instructions on how to use them with the pgrollup library.

1. Triggers can impose significant overhead on the `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` operations of the database.
   A statement that invokes a trigger is not done executing until all of the triggers are done executing,
   and triggers cannot execute in parallel.
   This implies that a table with many rollups will suffer significant performance degradation when modifying its contents.

   The pgrollup extension solves this problem by removing the need for these expensive triggers.
   The updates to the rollup tables can happen fully in parallel in background cron processes,
   so `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` performance remains exactly as it did before.
   The [Modes]() Section below describes the implementation details for how this works internally.
  
## The Solution

The pgrollup extension provides a simple interface for creating rollups that solves all of the problems of the previous solutions.
The following code loads the extension:

```
CREATE LANGUAGE pgplpython3u;
CREATE EXTENSION pgrollup;
```

The current implementation of pgrollup requires the `pgplpython3u` language and python >= 3.6.
For a discussion of why python is required, see the [Limitations]() section below.

In order to fully demonstrate the power of the pgrollup extension, we will also load the `hll` and `tdigest` extensions below:
```
CREATE EXTENSION hll;
CREATE EXTENSION tdigest;
```
These extensions are not strictly required to be loaded,
and the functionality of pgrollup will gracefully degrade if they are not present.

We can now create a managed rollup table that represents the same information as our materialized view above with the following command:
```
SELECT create_rollup(
    'access_logs',
    'access_logs_rollup',
    rollups => $$
        count(*)                    AS num_connections,
        hll(ipaddr)                 AS hll_ips,
        min(bytes_transferred)      AS min_bytes,
        max(bytes_transferred)      AS max_bytes,
        avg(bytes_transferred)      AS avg_bytes,
        stddev(bytes_transferred)   AS stddev_bytes,
        tdigest(bytes_transferred)  AS tdigest_bytes
    $$,
    wheres => $$
        status_code
    $$
);
```

Warnings:

If you have a smallint in the basetable, and do sum(smallint), the sum is also a smallint and this can result in sql errors on overflow;
you should probably cast the type to integer/bigint in the materialized view.

Limitations:
1. only supports a single table, and not views/joins

1. Internally uses 

## TODO

easy:

1. sorting with a btree index only scan

1. use `count(*)` to implement aggregateless tables

1. DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW event trigger

1. use the storage parameter WITH syntax

1. set pg_catalog.pg_table_is_visible to FALSE for all the auxiliary tables

medium:

1. better parsing https://github.com/pganalyze/queryparser/tree/master/extension

    1. filter syntax on aggregates

1. multiparameter aggregate functions (will affect tdigest, datasketches, allows implementing lots of built-in aggs)

1. use aggregate combining functions by default

1. better tracking of dependencies using postgres built-in features

1. benchmarks

1. good interface for settings
    1. allowing deletes for non-groups

1. views on other views

hard

1. outer joins

1. subqueries
